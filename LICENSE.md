# ISB License 1.0.0
*(Based on the PolyForm Small Business License 1.0.0)*  
<https://polyformproject.org/licenses/small-business/1.0.0>

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree
to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all
your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
software to do everything you might do with the software
that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright
in it for any permitted purpose. However, you may
only distribute the software according to [Distribution
License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works
based on the software according to [Changes and New Works
License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license
to distribute copies of the software. Your license
to distribute covers distributing the software with
changes and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works
License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
with the software. For example:

> Required Notice: Copyright Rizky Denianto (https://github.com/rizkydenianto)

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
make changes and new works based on the software for any
permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
to license, that you would infringe by using the software.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

## Gross Revenue Limitation

Use of the software for the benefit of your company is use for
a **permitted purpose** if your company has **gross revenue of less than
Rp 4,800,000,000 (four billion eight hundred million Indonesian rupiah)**
in the prior tax year, as defined under relevant Indonesian tax
regulations, including *Peraturan Menteri Keuangan Republik Indonesia
Nomor 197/PMK.03/2013* and its successors.

If your company exceeds this gross revenue threshold in any subsequent
tax year, continued use of the software for the benefit of your company
is not a permitted purpose. In that case, you must either:
1. Stop using the software for the benefit of your company, or
2. Obtain a separate commercial license from the licensor.

This threshold may be adjusted in the future according to changes
in Indonesian tax regulations that modify the definition of small
businesses or non-PKP entities.

---

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately.
If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***
